At
incremental return on ad spend (iROAS) by using large-scale geographic randomized
controlled trials (RCT). This article provides a detailed explanation of how to design and
execute such experiments.

Those previous writings covered extensively why geo experiments offer the
working in your marketing mix compared to user-level experiments, quasi-experiments (e.g., synthetic
control, matched market tests), attribution, and other observational methods. This piece focuses on how:
the practical implementation of high-quality large-scale geographic RCTs.

This workflow summarizes the end-to-end process for running advertising experiments. The final stage –
benchmarking – compiles results from all experiments into a growing evidence base. As advertisers, agencies,
and media companies accumulate dozens, then hundreds, or even thousands of tests, these benchmarks become a
powerful source of insight. They reveal what truly works in advertising and provide expected effect sizes by media
channel, ad format, partner, product category, and other key dimensions.

Enterprise AI is coming, and it’s about to learn all the wrong lessons about marketing effectiveness



## FIRST STEPS

Before designing the experiment, several foundational questions should be addressed.

DETERMINE THE RESEARCH QUESTION

STATE YOUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVE AND THE DECISION TO BE SUPPORTED

Experiments are not as difficult or expensive as
many marketers perceive or portray them, but
they do require resources and calendar time,
so run them only when the answer will drive a
meaningful business decision. Geo experiments
are almost always “intent to treat”(ITT) designs,
where treatment is tracked at the geographic
level rather than the individual level. You know
which geographic populations were intended to
receive treatment, not which individuals actually
saw the ads. This means your media investment
must be substantial enough to detectably move
KPIs at the geographic level. This technique isn’t
suited for relatively small campaigns or very rare
conversions.


Start by measuring sales effects for your largest
media channels to validate and calibrate
coefficient assumptions in your marketing mix
model. From there, having laid a baseline of
channel-level validation and gotten a grounding
in best practices for conducting experiments,
researchers can branch out into nuances of the
mix, such as the effectiveness of particular media
partners, subchannel tactics, media formats and
so forth.


Most importantly, identify the specific business
decision that will be made based on the results,
with marketing, analytics and finance working in
concert. A well-constructed geo experiment that
doesn’t inform action is a waste of resources.



Example business objectives:

• Validate that the impact of a marketing channel,
such as Search (or Television, Social, Retail
Media, etc.) matches our marketing mix model’s
(MMM)
coefficients, and if not, investigate (and
experiment) further with a view to calibrate the
MMM accordingly and reevaluate investment
levels

• Measure iROAS of a media partner, such as Meta
(or Google, Spotify, Disney, etc.) as a channel
partner and renegotiate or reallocate if results
are unfavorable
• Evaluate iROAS of a tactic, such as Retargeting
(or Lookalike Targeting, Branded Search
Keywords, Geo-fencing, etc.) and adjust
investment accordingly

DEFINE KEY EXPERIMENT VARIABLES

Next, we define the key parameters that will structure the experiment.


INDEPENDENT VARIABLE:
THE MEDIA INVESTMENT

In an experiment, the independent variable is
what you modify between test and control groups
to measure its effect on the outcome variable.
For advertising experiments, this means the ad
campaign or media channel being tested, whether
branded search, social media, television, or
another tactic.


Since we’re designing geographic experiments,
it’s crucial to verify that your chosen medium
can reliably target different geographic units
sufficiently for your testing objectives. This
capability varies significantly across media types
and platforms. Examples, as of this writing:
Linear TV can be tested effectively using DMA
targeting through providers like Ampersand or
Nexstar, but individual networks like CBS or AMC
may lack sufficient scale or targeting granularity.
Spotify enables geo-targeting for streaming music
and run-of-network podcasts but not for host-read
spots on specific shows. Amazon supports geotargeting
for display and video on-site and their
DSP but not for sponsored product keywords that
comprise most retail media budgets. ZIP codes are
not a stable testing unit for most media.


DEPENDENT VARIABLE:
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (KPI)

The dependent variable is the outcome you’re
measuring, ideally sales. The fundamental
assumption is that this outcome is influenced by
the independent variable: running advertising
increases sales. The experiment aims to quantify
this causal relationship by comparing against the
counterfactual baseline sales rate in the control
group absent the advertising stimulus.


Sales is the preferred KPI as it directly measures
iROAS, customer acquisition cost (CAC), and cost
per acquisition (CPA), all metrics that should
reflect true incrementality. Other outcomes such
as foot traffic, search activity, web visitation, and
brand lift can also be measured, but should be
measured with RCT to know if the ads are having a
true causal effect.


Critically, ensure you have reliable KPI data
that aligns with the experimental structure. For
geographic experiments, postal codes in customer
databases are ideal – no device graphs, tracking
pixels, or clean rooms required. Whether from
first-party CRM systems or partner panels, ZIP
codes easily roll up to most standard geographic
units, allowing straightforward determination of
whether each customer belonged to test or control
groups at the time of conversion.


EXPERIMENT UNIT: GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS

That doesn’t work with custom units such as radial
or hexagonal zones. In RCTs, “experiment units”
are the smallest entities to which treatment is
independently applied and which are subject to
randomization. For advertising, these could be
individuals, devices, households, or geographic
regions.


As explained in our article “Advertisers seeking
accurate ROAS should use large-scale, randomized
geo tests,”2 user- and household-level targeting
provides false precision. User-level tracking
accuracy has generally been overstated by
vendors, and Apple’s App Tracking Transparency
(ATT) and Safari browser have further degraded
online tracking capabilities.


2 Advertisers seeking accurate ROAS should use large-scale, randomized geo tests

The internet’s promise of 1:1 targeting was never
fully realized. Cookies are inherently unstable,
regularly deleted and lacking persistent identity.
Industry responded with complex identity graphs
and clean rooms. Users pushed back with ad
blockers, while governments enacted privacy laws
like GDPR. As a result, when marketers attempt to
match campaign-exposed audiences to first-party
outcome data, match rates typically range from
50-60% or less.


Even at 80%, this introduces too much noise to
reliably detect typical advertising effects of 1-5%
with statistical confidence.


This explains the rise of geographic experiments.
Using geo regions as experimental units forms
what’s known as cluster-randomized trials (CRT),
where geographic clusters of individuals are
randomly assigned to treatment conditions.


Geographic experiments offer multiple
advantages. They sidestep privacy concerns by
eliminating the need for personally identifiable
information. Sales and other KPIs align naturally
with this structure through ZIP-coded transaction
data from CRM systems, without privacy
implications or technical overhead.


Most media can accurately target large geographic
regions, particularly Nielsen’s designated market
areas (DMAs). While postal codes, cable zones,
core based statistical areas (CBSAs), and states
are alternatives, each presents challenges. Postal
codes would be ideal, but as we’ve written in
AdExchanger3, media companies currently infer
them from IP addresses with high error rates
or accumulate multiple ZIPs per user account,
making them unreliable for experimentation
without additional system enhancements


Geographic regions suitable for experimentation
must be mutually exclusive and sufficiently
isolated to minimize spillover between test and
control groups4, upholding the experimentation
best practice known as Stable Unit Treatment
Value Assumption (SUTVA). Ideally, units should
also be collectively exhaustive (MECE: mutually
exclusive and collectively exhaustive).


DMAs meet these criteria well. They’re mutually
exclusive and collectively exhaustive across the
US. Most people don’t commute between DMAs

–
while NYC and Philadelphia DMAs border each
other, their populations generally live and work
within one or the other. With 210 US DMAs,
randomization can balance the many factors
affecting regional sales: income levels, education,
competitive mixes, weather, and more.
Critically, virtually all media types can be targeted
reliably by DMA in the US, a practice established
since the 1950s.

Outside the US, metro areas or postal-code
clusters typically work best.


Bear in mind, we’re talking here about the RCT
subclass of cluster randomized trials, so don’t
confuse this approach with matched-market
tests (MMT) or synthetic control method (SCM).
Those are forms of quasi-experiments, a scientific
designation that means “not as good as real
experiments,” defined by a lack of randomization
of assignments of test and control arms. This
paper focuses on how to conduct geo RCTs for
iROAS measurement and doesn’t get into why
CRT provides categorically better evidence than
MMT or SCM. For more on that discussion, refer
to the articles cited in Footnote 1.


For this paper, we will focus on large-scale
randomized geographic experiments using DMAs
as the experimental unit.

2011)



## SELECT DESIGN TYPE

There are myriad types of designs for running experiments. We have already narrowed
to some key parameters, such as that we are focusing on using geographic regions for the
experiment units and also that we are using an intent-to-treat (ITT) design, meaning that we
do not need to track who in the test group was actually treated with the campaign exposure,

and that treatment is withheld from everyone in the control group. We will briefly discuss

here a few other more design details, but settle on one for the rest of this paper.

Different business questions give rise to different experimental design choices.

Those include:

• ‘Rolling Thunder’: Multi-armed, stepped CRT: This design offers greater statistical power than
a traditional two-celled test by generating many independent contrasts across time and treatment arms5.
Each group enters treatment in a staggered sequence and remains in for a fixed duration, creating
repeated observations both within and across DMAs. This structure increases the precision of the causal
estimate while reducing sensitivity to outliers or time-based shocks. The design is particularly well-
suited for cessation testing: by phasing off the media gradually, advertisers can closely monitor sales
impact, minimize the risk of revenue loss, and halt the test early if needed.

This diagram shows a test structure for evaluating THE sales impact of media. It is useful for testing in a new channel but also as a
cessation test for pausing an always-on media channel the advertiser believes is essential to sales. We have nicknamed this design type
“Rolling Thunder.” In this example, four treatment groups are turned off in staggered 4-week windows to minimize overall disruption.
At any given time, only a subset of the country is in test: in this example, typically one-sixth, and at most one-third (in weeks 4, 7, and 10).
Multiple control groups and spacing between test flights reduce risk. Rules for halting the test based on observed negative impact should
be pre-specified during the design phase. The configuration, including number of test arms, treatment duration, and control size, should
be guided by pre-test power analysis to ensure detectability of the expected effect size.
TREATMENTS

5 Stepped wedge designs could reduce the required sample size in cluster randomized trials”
(Woertman, de Hoop et al., 2013)


• Targeting Test: To see if the iROAS of
a targeting technique pays off, this three-armed
design includes one test group for targeting,
one test group for minimally targeted media
using the same creative, and one unexposed
control group.
• Media Bake-Off Trial: When comparing
two media channels against one another
for the superior ROI, a three-armed test,
one for medium A, one for medium B and
a control group
• Media Bake-Off Plus Interaction Effect:
A four-armed test compares iROAS of two media
properties plus their interaction effect, with one
exposed to medium A, one medium B, one both,
and one unexposed control group, using factorial
design and analysis
• Intensity Trial: For determining optimal
media weight and calibrating diminishing
returns, a multi-armed test where different
groups receive varying media levels (e.g.,
50%, 100%, 200% of baseline spend) plus an
unexposed control. Unlike cessation tests which
measure what’s lost when media stops, intensity
trials identify the point of maximum efficiency by
testing increased investment levels. This design
reveals whether doubling spend doubles impact
or if returns diminish, critical for optimizing
budgets rather than just validating them.
• Parallel Two-celled Test: This is the most
basic design for a lift test, answering the
question of how much incremental effect an ad
campaign/channel/publisher/tactic or other ad
strategy as on a desired outcome, such as sales,
with one test group and one control. Statistically
weaker than Rolling Thunder design:
recommended only for estimated effect size great
than 5%
Practitioners may opt to have different ratios
of the various arms of the experiments, but our
recommendation is to use equal probability in
assigning arms whether that’s 50/50 for twoarmed
tests or likewise for any other number
of splits. Uneven ratios between test and control
weaken the statistical power of the test and risk
skewing the sample between the arms.
The analysis for each of the designs mentioned
above functions similarly.

## DESIGN THE EXPERIMENT

With the business problem defined and the experimental approach selected we can now

proceed to the detailed design.

DEFINE EXPERIMENT
PARAMETERS

EFFECT SIZE

Specify the effect size you intend to detect,
typically expressed as a percent lift in the primary
KPI (e.g., sales). This value should reflect what
the business would consider meaningful, based
on past campaign benchmarks, modeling outputs
(e.g., marketing mix models or multitouch
attribution models), or practical judgment.
For example, an expected lift of ~3% may be
a reasonable planning target for most large
consumer brands.


It may feel odd to have to estimate this quantity,
since the point of the experiment is to determine
its value. Don’t think of this as a forecast.
Instead, think of this as the minimum lift that
would be worth detecting based on your business.
A point of departure for this, if lacking any better
guidance, is what would be the minimum lift
required to generate positive iROAS for
the campaign. The lift estimate is an input
to power analysis that anchors the design in
real-world relevance.


Power analysis will assess whether the proposed
design can detect this effect with sufficient
probability and may show that the setup is
sensitive enough to detect even smaller effects.
Avoid designing the experiment to detect only the
absolute minimum effect you think might occur,
as this can overfit assumptions and raise the risk
of an underpowered test.


Where feasible, simulate power across a range
of plausible effect sizes to assess robustness and
trade-offs in detectable lift. Given that this is
a how-to paper concerning experimental design,
this material gets at least a bit more technical
as it proceeds. We assume the reader has some
familiarity with modern statistical techniques,
but we trust that non-technical readers should be
able to follow the basic concepts as we continue.


CONFIDENCE LEVEL

Specify the confidence level that will be used to
test for statistical significance. The standard is
95%, corresponding to a significance threshold
(α) of 0.05, although 90% confidence is often
acceptable for marketing purposes.


This determines the risk of a false positive (“Type
I error”), i.e., concluding there was an effect when
there wasn’t. A 95% confidence level implies that,
under the null hypothesis (the opposite of the
hypothesis), there’s a 5% chance of incorrectly
declaring a statistically significant result.


TEMPORAL WINDOWS

Pre-Period (Baseline) Length


Set a baseline window – eight weeks is usually
sufficient, depending on sales cycles – to
normalize each DMA’s trend before treatment.
This period is used for trend stabilization and
covariate adjustment. Justify that it is long enough
to smooth out short-term noise but recent enough
to reflect current conditions. Avoid choosing
periods that include holidays or anomalies
unrepresentative of the test window.



Exposure Period
whether post-period sales will be (1) included


Determine the active test duration based on
expected consumer response. For high-reach
media (e.g., TV or digital display), a 4-6 week
exposure is often sufficient. For lower-latency
channels (e.g., search, retail media), a shorter
window may suffice. Ensure media weight
and pacing can be reliably sustained during
this period. This can be informed during the
simulations of the power analysis.


Post-Period (Observation Window)


Decide whether to measure lift only during
exposure or include a tail period to capture
delayed effects. Include a wash-out buffer if
you expect lingering media influence that could
contaminate post-test analysis. Pre-specify

in the primary lift calculation, (2) analyzed
separately as a decay effect, or (3) excluded
entirely as a buffer period. This prevents post-hoc
decisions that could bias results.


Seasonality Alignment

Ensure that the pre-period and test period reflect
comparable seasonal patterns. Avoid scheduling
the experiment so that only one period includes
major events like holidays, back-to-school, or
Black Friday, unless both periods are expected
to show similar seasonal dynamics. Misaligned
timing can introduce artificial differences that
may be mistaken for treatment effects. Marketing
mix models can be used to create seasonally
adjusted conversions in situations where bridging
a “seasonal change” is unavoidable.

This line chart shows total weekly transactions across the U.S., grouped by month. While week-to-week variation is modest,
a consistent seasonal pattern emerges: slower sales in early January, surges in mid-spring and summer, and a notable decline beginning
around Thanksgiving that continues through Christmas. This trend is based on real national sales data for a Fortune 500 company
and underscores the importance of pre-period normalization when designing geographic RCTs to control for seasonality that could
otherwise bias treatment effect estimates.

GEOGRAPHIC CLUSTER SPECIFICATION

Unit Definition


In our example, we have determined to use DMAs
as the cluster unit. They are mutually exclusive,
cover the full U.S. population, and reflect media-
buying logic with minimal spillover across
boundaries. Their scale makes them well-suited
for randomization and aggregate KPI tracking.


Sampling Frame

Use all 210 US DMAs rather than a subset to
ensure generalizability to national campaigns.
Full-market inclusion maximizes statistical
power and captures regional heterogeneity, while
limited-DMA designs introduce selection bias and
restrict external validity of results.


Assignment Probability


Apply equal probability randomization (typically
50/50 for two arms, or 33/33/33 for three arms,
etc.) across all included DMAs. This ensures each
geographic unit has the same chance of receiving
treatment, preserving the statistical properties
needed for unbiased causal inference.


Exclusion Criteria

Define up front which DMAs may be excluded,
and why. Valid reasons include things like low
store count, data sparsity, regulatory constraints,
or known structural anomalies. Aim to keep
the full set of 210 DMAs unless exclusions are
methodologically necessary. Excluding DMAs
simply because they are large, account for a large
portion of sales, or are competitive are not ideal
exclusion criteria, as their inclusion inherently
makes the results of the experiment more
generalizable to real-world conditions. Forcing
them into the test group is also a bad idea, moving
out of the realm of being a randomized trial and
into quasi-experiment territory.


Minimum Cluster Size

Set a clear inclusion threshold (e.g., “DMAs
with fewer than 500 transactions per week may
be excluded”) to avoid excess variance from
underpowered regions. Document the rationale in
the design phase to avoid ad hoc decisions
post hoc.


Spillover/Contamination Safeguards

To prevent treatment effects from leaking into
control DMAs, implement geo-targeting controls
(e.g., frequency caps, DMA-level pacing). Set up
monitoring protocols to track media delivery and
investigate outliers.


OUTCOME DATA
REQUIREMENTS

DATA SOURCE AND FORMAT

The experiment requires comprehensive sales
(or other KPI) data at the geographic level for both
historical power analysis (ideally 2 years) and the
test period. Two primary sources are available:


First-Party CRM Data (Preferred):


• Extract daily or weekly transaction counts or
sales volumes by ZIP code (daily preferred)
• Requires: buyer ZIP code and transaction date
(daily or weekly) for aggregated sales counts
• Provides maximum flexibility and granularity
• No additional licensing costs
Third-Party Syndicated Data:


• Sources: NielsenIQ, Circana (formerly IRI),
or similar providers
• Often pre-aggregated to DMA level
• Weekly granularity typical (daily may be cost-
prohibitive but provides greater statistical power)
• Necessary for CPG and other industries without
direct sales data

KPI DATA STRUCTURE

Outcome data for a geo test is typically simple,
with three columns: date, sales count (or
volume), and geography (ZIP code or DMA).
If the advertiser has comprehensive first-party
transaction data with ZIP codes in the customer
record, outcomes should be aggregated by ZIP.
If using a third-party panel such as NielsenIQ or
Circana, DMA-level aggregation is sufficient. ZIP
codes can be rolled up to DMAs using standard
match tables from Nielsen or other providers.


While sales is the preferred outcome metric, other
KPIs can be substituted in this structure, such as
web form completions, brand search volume (from
Google Trends, reported by DMA), or foot traffic
(via third-party mobility data providers). Metrics
can be reported daily or weekly. Sales can be
expressed as counts or continuous dollar values.

DATA PREPARATION

For first-party data:


1.
Extract transactions with valid ZIP codes and
dates
2.
Aggregate to daily or weekly counts/volumes
by ZIP
3.
Apply ZIP-to-DMA mapping table (available
from Nielsen or other providers)
4.
Sum to DMA-week or DMA-day level
For third-party data:

1.
Verify that DMA definitions match media
targeting parameters
2.
Confirm data completeness and reporting lag
3.
Align time periods with experimental design
METRIC SELECTION

Choose between transaction counts (categorical)
or sales volume (continuous):


• Counts: More stable, less affected by outliers,
simpler statistical properties
• Volume: Captures full business impact but
may require transformation (log, square root) if
highly skewed

Document this choice as it affects power
calculations and analysis methods.


WHERE POSSIBLE, USE DAILY KPI
AGGREGATIONS, WHICH PROVIDE MORE
STATISTICAL POWER THAN WEEKLY.
AVOID MONTHLY ROLL-UPS.

FORMULATE HYPOTHESIS

A good experimental hypothesis is a clear, testable
statement about the expected causal effect of a
treatment. It should specify:


• The direction and magnitude of expected impact
(e.g., a lift of at least X%)
• The outcome metric (e.g., sales revenue)
• The comparison groups (treatment vs. control
DMAs)
• The timeframe
• The confidence level required for the test
The hypothesis makes explicit what you believe
the intervention will accomplish and provides
stakeholders with a shared understanding of
success criteria.


UNDERSTANDING HYPOTHESIS TESTING

Statistical testing doesn’t “prove” a
hypothesis true. Instead, it attempts to reject
the opposite – the null hypothesis. The null
hypothesis typically states there is no effect or that
the effect is less than the pre-specified minimum.
If the data are sufficiently inconsistent with the
null hypothesis at your chosen confidence level,
you reject it in favor of your research hypothesis.


Example Based on Business Objectives:

For the objective: “Measure iROAS of Meta as a
channel partner and renegotiate or reallocate if
results are unfavorable,” the following hypothesis
and null hypothesis could apply:


Research Hypothesis (H₁):

Meta advertising will generate a statistically

significant lift in sales revenue of at least 3% in
treatment DMAs compared to control DMAs
during the 5-week test period, measured at the
95% confidence level.


Null Hypothesis (H₀):

Meta advertising will not generate a statistically

significant lift in sales revenue of at least
3% in treatment DMAs compared to control
DMAs during the 5-week test period at the 95%
confidence level.


If we reject the null hypothesis, we have evidence
supporting Meta’s effectiveness. If we fail to reject
it, either the true effect is smaller than 3%, the test
lacked sufficient power, or Meta genuinely doesn’t
drive meaningful incremental sales at current
spend levels.


Note that “failing to reject” the null hypothesis
doesn’t prove Meta ineffective; it may indicate the
need for a longer test, higher spend, or acceptance
that the channel drives modest but still positive
returns below our detection threshold. Likewise,
rejecting the null doesn’t “prove” our hypothesis
true; it provides evidence that the observed effect
is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. At a
95% confidence level, there’s a 5% probability of
incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis (Type I
error). While we cannot prove hypotheses through
statistical testing, we can accumulate evidence
that makes certain ## CONCLUSIONs more or less
plausible given our data and assumptions.


RANDOMIZATION LOGIC

SIMPLE RANDOMIZATION AS THE DEFAULT

At its core, randomization is straightforward: we
flip a fair coin (metaphorically) for each DMA to
determine whether it receives treatment or serves
as control. This simple approach, assigning each
of the 210 DMAs to treatment or control with
equal probability, forms the foundation of our
experimental design.


(To see code for how it would work in practice, see
Appendix A, Example 1: Simple Randomization
for Geographic RCT.)
For the complete implementation, see [Simple Randomization Code](./code/simple_randomization.py).

This approach might seem too simple – won’t
random chance sometimes create imbalanced
groups? The key insight is that with 210 units and
our comprehensive power analysis methodology,
simple randomization works remarkably well ,
particularly in the multi-armed, stepped design
dubbed Rolling Thunder.

This visualization demonstrates the balance achieved using the Rolling Thunder experimental framework with six test
groups (A-F) and one control group during a 9-week experimental window, where the design enhances the control group
by incorporating pre-treatment observations from test groups B through F before their respective 4-week treatment
periods begin. With 150 DMAs randomly assigned across seven groups, the enhanced Control group achieved a mean of
2,136 sales per week (standard error = 335) compared to the Test group’s mean of 2,134 sales per week (standard error =
368), with a two-sample t-test yielding t statistic = 0.03, p-value = 0.997, confirming no statistically significant difference
between groups (<1% difference in means). The custom boxplot format displays the interquartile range (box), median
(horizontal line within box), mean (thick horizontal line), and whiskers extending to mean ± 1 standard error, with no
outliers shown. These values from a Fortune 500 company’s actual sales data demonstrate how the Rolling Thunder
framework naturally improves balance through random assignment without stratification or re-weighting, supporting
robust causal inference while maintaining simplicity, with DMA-level normalization in the analysis phase further
ensuring treatment effects aren’t confounded by residual baseline differences.

consistently show high power (P-val < 0.05)
to detect target effects, we have empirical
evidence that chance imbalances from simple
randomization don’t systematically undermine
our design.


The pre-period normalization is particularly
important. By normalizing each DMA to its own
8-week trend before treatment, we are effectively
controlling for many potential confounders
without having to explicitly model them. The
Rolling Thunder design further enhances balance
by incorporating the pre-treatment weeks from
each test group into the control pool. This
staggered entry means that test groups B through
F contribute their early weeks as additional
control observations, naturally increasing the
effective control sample size and improving the
representativeness of the control group across
different time periods. This addresses the practical
concern that with only 210 units, chance alone
might produce treatment and control groups that
differed systematically on important variables.

Simulated Rolling Thunder Results: Treatment vs. Control Trend. This figure presents the outcome of a power-analysis
simulation of a geo-experiment using the Rolling Thunder framework with historical sales data from a real Fortune 500 company. Six test
groups (A-F) and one control group were created through random assignment of 150 DMAs, with each test group receiving treatment for
4 consecutive weeks starting in staggered fashion (Group A: weeks 1-4, Group B: weeks 2-5, etc.). The Rolling Thunder design enhances
the control group by incorporating pre-treatment observations from test groups B through F before their respective treatment periods
begin, naturally increasing the effective control sample size and improving balance. A 3% lift was artificially applied to each test group
during its treatment period, following an 8-week pre-period used for normalization to each DMA’s baseline (index = 100). The normalized
weekly sales index shows clear divergence between the aggregated Treatment and enhanced Control groups during the 9-week experiment
period. Statistical analysis using a two-sample t-test yields t = 2.16, p = 0.0363, confirming detection of the simulated lift at the 95%
confidence level. The underlying sales data and randomization are real; only the treatment lift was simulated as part of a power analysis
to assess the Rolling Thunder framework’s statistical sensitivity. This would be one of thousands of simulations in the power analysis.”
This demonstrates that the combination of control enhancement through staggered entry and DMA-level normalization provides robust
detection capability for modest treatment effects without requiring stratification or other complex balancing techniques.

Pre-period Normalization of Weekly Sales by DMA These line plots show raw and normalized weekly sales across 10
example DMAs. The first panel (Raw Weekly Sales) reveals large differences in baseline market size and week-to-week variance,
obscuring comparability across regions. The second panel (Normalized Weekly Sales Index) adjusts each DMA to its own pre-period
mean (set to 100), enabling meaningful comparisons of relative change.
Summary statistics confirm the effect of normalization: raw sales had a standard deviation of 263 and a coefficient of variation (CV)
of 0.165, whereas normalized sales had a standard deviation of 4.27 and a CV of 0.042. The sales data shown are actual transaction
records from a Fortune 500 compay. The balance shown between test and control cells – after normalization using each DMA’s
pre-period trend – is genuine, not synthetic. This example demonstrates why stratification is typically unnecessary when using all
210 DMAs with this normalization method.



ALTERNATIVE RANDOMIZATION
APPROACHES

Our simulation analyses demonstrate that the
Rolling Thunder design inherently improves
balance without requiring other such complex
techniques. By incorporating the pre-treatment
periods from all test groups (except the first)
into the control group, this approach naturally
enhances balance by leveraging observations from
the same DMAs that will later receive treatment.
The enhanced control group contains data from
nearly all DMAs, more accurately reflecting the full
population variance and making the framework
robust against initial randomization imbalances.
This natural balancing, combined with DMA-
level normalization to pre-period means, typically
provides sufficient statistical power for detecting
modest lift effects. Certain situations may still
benefit from more sophisticated approaches,
such as these:


STRATIFIED RANDOMIZATION

Groups DMAs by key characteristics before
randomizing within strata. (For sample
code, see Appendix A, Example 12: Stratified
Randomization.)


This guarantees balance on stratification variables
but requires careful selection of stratifying
covariates. Best when you can identify 2-3
clearly important variables (i.e., with strong
correlation to KPI) and have sufficient DMAs
within each stratum.


Example: Stratify by sales quartile to ensure
treatment and control arms have equal representation
ofhigh-,
medium-, and low-volume markets.


MATCHED-PAIR RANDOMIZATION

Pairs similar DMAs based on multiple
characteristics (e.g.,
past sales trends, populations,
competitive mix), then randomly assigns one from
each pair to treatment. Particularly valuable when
sample sizes are smaller or effect sizes are subtle.


IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
MATCHED-PAIR RANDOMIZATION VS.
MATCHED-MARKET TESTING

While the names sound similar, matched-pair
randomization is fundamentally different
from matched-market testing. In matched-
market testing (a quasi-experimental method),
you hand-pick specific control markets
that seem similar to your test markets:
there’s no randomization. In matched-
pair randomization, you still use random
assignment, but you do it within pairs of
similar markets, and large numbers of them.
This preserves the causal inference benefits of
randomization while improving balance.


Implementation:

First, calculate a similarity score between all
possible DMA pairs based on key metrics like
sales history, population, and demographics.
This can be done using statistical distance
measures that quantify how “far apart” two DMAs
are across multiple dimensions. Then, match
each DMA with its most similar partner.
Finally, use a randomization algorithm within
each pair to assign one to treatment and one
to control.


COVARIATE-CONSTRAINED RANDOMIZATION
(RE-RANDOMIZATION)

Generates multiple random assignments
(e.g., 10,000 draws) and selects one meeting
pre-specified balance criteria. Provides precise
control over balance without sacrificing
randomization principles.6

6 Rerandomization To Improve CovariateBalance In Experiments” (Morgan,
Rubin, 2012)

This is not a form of “p-hacking” (a bad practice,
in this case repeatedly analyzing data until you
find a significant result) because you’re not
looking at outcomes, you’re only checking whether
the random assignment created balanced groups
before the experiment even starts. As long as your
balance criteria are defined before seeing any
results, this technique maintains the integrity of
the randomization.


Balance assessment:

Use standardized mean differences (SMD)
with threshold of absolute SMD < 0.1 for core
covariates like pre-period sales and DMA
population.


POST-STRATIFICATION AND COVARIATE
ADJUSTMENT

Proceeds with initial randomization but adjusts
for imbalances in the statistical analysis phase
through regression or ANCOVA. Doesn’t change
assignment but can recover power lost to
imbalance.


These techniques become particularly valuable
when:


• Working with fewer than 210 DMAs (e.g.,
regional tests)
• Unable to run extensive historical simulations
• Stakeholders require demonstrable balance for
confidence
• Effect sizes are expected to be small (<2%)
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:

RCT ENHANCEMENTS VS.

QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The approaches above are all enhancements


within the RCT framework – they preserve


randomization while improving efficiency.


This is fundamentally different from quasi-

experimental approaches like:


• Propensity Score Methods in
observational studies that reweight based


on estimated treatment probability


• Synthetic Control Methods that
construct artificial control units from
weighted combinations and are subject to
over-fitting
TREATMENT INTENSITY
(“DOSAGE”)

QUANTIFICATION

Define the planned treatment dose in media
terms: impressions, GRPs, TRPs, or spend per
capita. Be specific and use a KPI that maps cleanly
to lift models.


RATIONALE

Confirm that this dosage is expected to produce
a lift equal to or greater than the expected effect
size. Link back to prior experiments or planning
models to justify that the level of spend can drive
a detectable effect.


MONITORING PLAN

Set up real-time dashboards or pacing reports to
ensure that delivery is on track. Allow for mid-
flight correction without altering randomization,
especially in high-stakes or high-budget tests.


TREATMENT-DELIVERY
VERIFICATION

Establishing robust monitoring systems before
launch ensures that the intended media exposure
actually reaches treatment DMAs while staying
out of control DMAs, a critical requirement for
valid causal inference.



DATA SOURCE

Specify the systems (e.g., DSP logs, third-party
verification platforms, media vendor reports)
that will confirm media delivery at the geographic
unit level.


COMPLIANCE METRICS

Define acceptable delivery bounds, e.g., “A DMA
is compliant if it receives ≥90% of planned
impressions within ±10% of schedule.” Track
and report compliance systematically for each
treatment DMA.


DATA QUALITY
& LATENCY RULES

LATENCY TOLERANCE

Specify acceptable reporting lag, e.g., “All sales
must be posted to the warehouse within five days
of transaction date.” Define a cut-off date for
primary analysis to allow for complete data.


DATA AUDITS

Schedule at least one interim extract during the
test to verify record counts, completeness, and
DMA-level mapping. Use this as a QA step to
confirm integrity before final analysis.


BUSINESS SAFEGUARDS

MINIMUM CONTROLS

If relevant (e.g., in a cessation test), declare a
minimum media presence in control DMAs to
avoid business disruption or brand risk.


EARLY-STOP CRITERIA

If conditional stopping is allowed, e.g., to prevent
severe loss of sales in a cessation test, pre-register
the interim check schedule and thresholds.
For example: “Interim analysis after 2 weeks;

stop test if sales decline exceeds 15% with 98.5%
confidence.”

Note that checking results early requires more
stringent significance thresholds to maintain
overall experiment integrity – if you peek at
results multiple times, you increase the chance of
false ## CONCLUSIONs. Common approaches include
requiring p < 0.015 for early stops (versus p <

0.05 for final analysis) or using sequential testing
methods that adjust thresholds based on the
number of looks.
Define governance clearly: who has authority to
stop the test, what evidence is required, and what
happens to the analysis if early stopping occurs.


OPTIONAL: MULTIPLE
OUTCOMES & SUBGROUPS

While we strongly recommend focusing on a single
primary KPI to maintain clarity and statistical
rigor, some tests may require secondary analyses.
The critical principle: any additional outcomes
must be specified during the design phase, not
added post hoc after seeing results.


SECONDARY KPIS

If you must track additional metrics (e.g.,
transactions, average order value, new-customer
rate), pre-declare whether p-values will be
corrected for multiple comparisons (e.g., Holm-
Bonferroni) or considered purely exploratory.
Remember that each additional hypothesis test
increases the risk of false positives.


SUBGROUP ANALYSIS

Similarly, any planned subgroup analyses (e.g.,
high- vs. low-income DMAs, urban vs. rural)
should be specified at the design phase. These will
be tested using interaction terms in the primary
model, not as separate experiments. Be cautious:
subgroup analyses are often underpowered and
can lead to spurious findings.



## CONDUCT POWER ANALYSIS

Power analysis is a critical step in designing a geographic RCT. It evaluates whether
the experiment design, given its parameters, can reliably detect a meaningful effect size.

Rather than relying solely on theoretical variance assumptions, we use a simulation-based
power analysis grounded in real-world sales data. This approach provides an empirical

check on whether the design is likely to produce statistically significant results, and helps

quantify the test’s sensitivity under realistic conditions.

HISTORICAL DATA
REQUIREMENTS FORSIMULATION

The simulation requires the same data format as
the actual experiment. (For a code example, see
Appendix A, Example 2: Power Analysis Data
Structure.)
For the required data structure format, see [power_analysis_data_structure.py](./code/power_analysis_data_structure.py).

For first-party data, this means:


1.
Two years of historical ZIP-level transactions
2.
Same aggregation logic as planned for test
period

3.
Same ZIP-to-DMA mapping to ensure
consistency

For syndicated data:

1.
Negotiate access to historical data (ideally
2 years)
2.
Verify no methodology changes during
this period

3.
Account for any markets with incomplete
history

The power simulation will use this exact data
structure, preserving real-world variance patterns,
seasonality, and DMA-specific trends that
theoretical calculations would miss.


SIMULATION-BASED POWER ESTIMATION

We simulate the experiment using ideally two
years of historical weekly sales data to reflect true
patterns of variance, seasonality, and DMA-level
idiosyncrasies. The simulation process mirrors the
structure of the planned experiment:


Step-by-Step Simulation Process:


(For sample code, see Appendix A, Example

13: Power Simulation Framework for detailed
implementation.)
1.
Randomly sample multiple possible test
windows from the historical period. For a
planned 6-week test, we would sample dozens
of different 6-week windows across the two
years, preserving the calendar structure of
pre- and post-periods. This captures different
seasonal contexts – a test in Q4 may behave
differently than Q2.
2.
Vary the treatment duration
systematically. Run parallel simulations at 3,
4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks. While 4-6 weeks
is often the sweet spot for balancing cost and
statistical power, only simulation reveals
the actual trade-offs for your specific sales
patterns.
3.
Apply the DMA normalization process
that mirrors our actual analysis. For each
simulation:

Cell values show p-values from statistical tests at each combination of monthly conversions and minimum detectable
effect size. This example shows the following assumed parameters: control fraction of 20%; 10 weeks total experiment time; 7 groups across
all 210 DMAs; conversions distributed in proportion to population. Green cells: Statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (p < 0.05).
Orange to red cells: Increasingly non-significant results (p ≥ 0.05), indicating lower power to detect the effect.


• Calculate each DMA’s average weekly sales
during its 8-week pre-period
• Compute the week-over-week growth rate
during this baseline
• Project expected sales during the test period
based on this trend

Express actual test-period sales as an index
relative to this projection.
This normalization
is crucial: it transforms raw sales (which
vary greatly by DMA size) into comparable
lift indices, dramatically reducing variance.

4. Randomly assign DMAs to treatment
and control groups using the same
randomization logic planned for the
real experiment (typically equal odds of
assignment to all experiment arms).

5.Simulate a treatment effect by inflating
normalized sales values in the treatment
group during the test period by the
hypothesized effect size (e.g., 3%, 5%). This
creates the “signal” we’re trying to detect
against the “noise” of natural variation.
6.
Estimate treatment effects using the
planned analysis method (e.g., DMA-level
t-test on the normalized values).
7.
Test for statistical significance at the
pre-specified confidence level (e.g., 95%).
8.
Repeat this process thousands of times,
with different test windows, treatment
assignments, and durations to build a robust
empirical distribution of power outcomes.
KEY SIMULATION OUTPUTS

The Monte Carlo simulation yields several
critical insights:

• Power curves by duration: Shows
probability of detecting effects at 3%, 5%, 7% lift
for each test length
• Minimum detectable effect (MDE): The
smallest lift where power exceeds 80%


• Optimal test configuration:The duration that
minimizes MDE while keeping the test practical
For example, simulations might reveal:

• 3-week test: 80% power only at 7%+ lift (too
insensitive)
• 5-week test: 80% power at 3.5% lift (good balance)

• 8-week test: 80% power at 2.8% lift (marginal
improvement for 60% more media cost)
This section demonstrates ICC estimation and application. The complete implementation is in [icc_estimation.py](./code/icc_estimation.py).
ESTIMATING AND APPLYING INTRACLASS
CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (ICC)

Within the simulation process, we also estimate
the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). This
measures how similar sales values are within
each DMA over time relative to between DMAs,
and informs how much clustering is reducing the
effective number of observations.7

Understanding ICC Impact:

• Low ICC (< 0.05): DMAs behave relatively
independently week-to-week. Each week adds
substantial information.
• High ICC (> 0.20):
Strong within-DMA correlation.
Adding weeks provides diminishing returns.
A high ICC indicates that data within each DMA
are highly correlated – meaning that more
weeks (or switching to daily data) are needed to
compensate for the lack of independence. Because
we treat the number of DMAs as fixed (typically all
210), we must adjust for ICC through test duration
and data granularity:


Practical Adjustments for High ICC:


1.
Extend the test window to observe more
time points. If ICC = 0.15, you might need 6
weeks instead of 4 to achieve target power.
2.
Switch to daily data, if day-to-day variation
adds usable signal. Daily data often shows
lower ICC than weekly aggregates, effectively
increasing sample size.
3.
Run parallel simulations with different
granularities and durations to identify the
most power-efficient combination. Sometimes
4 weeks of daily data outperforms 6 weeks of
weekly data.
(For a code example, see Appendix A, Example 3:
Estimating And Applying Intraclass Correlation
Coefficient).


SETTING POWER TARGETS AND
MAKING DECISIONS

STATISTICAL POWER TARGET

Statistical power is the probability that the
experiment will detect a real effect if one exists.
A typical power target is 80%, though 90% may be
preferred for high-stakes tests. This target should
be pre-committed and documented in the protocol
to avoid post hoc reinterpretation.


DECISION FRAMEWORK

Once the simulation yields a power curve,
identify the design configuration (duration,
data granularity, MDE) that meets or exceeds
the power target. The goal is to ensure that if
the treatment works as hypothesized, it will be
reliably detected, given the noise and clustering in
real-world data.


Key decision points:

1.
If power is too low at business-relevant effect sizes:
• Extend test duration (most common solution)

Increase media weight to drive larger effects
•Broaden KPI scope (e.g., full brand line vs.
single product)

Switch to daily data if available
2.If power is very high (>95%): •
Consider shortening the test to save budget
•
Test more subtle tactics or lower spend levels
•
Run multiple sequential tests instead
of one long test
3.
Document the final configuration:
•
“5-week test achieves 83% power to detect
3% lift”
•
“Daily data improves MDE from 3.5%
to 2.8% vs. weekly”
•
“Extending beyond 6 weeks provides
minimal power gain”

## EXECUTE THE EXPERIMENT

PRE-LAUNCH VERIFICATION

Before launching the test campaign run through this checklist:


Media Setup Verification:


□
Treatment DMA lists uploaded
to all platforms
□
Control DMA exclusions properly configured,
if necessary for a given medium
(otherwise, pure holdout will suffice)
□
Geo-targeting set to “exact”
(no radius expansion)
□
Frequency caps consistent across platforms
□
Creative assets identical in all DMAs
□
Budget distributed across Treatment DMAs
proportional to pre-test KPI rate
Data Pipeline Verification:


□
Historical sales data passes integrity checks
□
ZIP→DMA mapping uses current DMA
definitions consistent with the medium’s
targeting
□
Sales reporting latency documented
and acceptable
□
Compliance monitoring dashboard live
□
Backup data extraction plan in place

LAUNCH AND MONITOR

WEEK 1 - SOFT LAUNCH:

• Daily compliance checks: spend by DMA vs. plan
• Verify targeting accuracy
• Investigate any Control DMA with >0% spend
• Verify Treatment DMAs receiving impressions
WEEKS 2-5 - FULL FLIGHT:

Establish a monitoring cadence:

Monday AM : Pull weekend delivery data
Monday PM : Calculate compliance metrics by DMA

Tuesday AM􀀄: Flag DMAs outside 90-110% of plan􀀄
Tuesday PM􀀄: Adjust bids/budgets (not targeting)􀀄
Wednesday􀀄: Spot-check creative rotation􀀄
Thursday􀀄: Review week-to-date pacing􀀄
Friday􀀄: Send compliance report to stakeholders􀀄

CRITICAL RULES:

1.
Never change DMA assignments - This breaks randomization
2.
Document all adjustments - Include timestamp and rationale
3.
Don’t peek at results - Avoid the temptation to check lift mid-flight unless conditional stopping
was pre-established
4.
Maintain spend ratios - If cutting budget is necessary, due to business conditions, cut
proportionally across all DMAs

COMPLIANCE MONITORING

Track these metrics weekly:


METRIC ON TARGET YELLOW FLAG RED FLAG
% TREATMENT DMAS COMPLIANT

% CONTROL DMAS WITH SPILLOVER

SPEND VARIANCE ACROSS TREATMENT

PLATFORM DELIVERY DISCREPANCIES

COMMON MID-FLIGHT ISSUES AND
SOLUTIONS

Problem: Underspending in small DMAs


• Solution: Increase bids/spend, not targeting
parameters
• Document markets affected and adjustment
dates
Problem: Platform reporting discrepancies


For example, Facebook Ads Manager shows 1,200
conversions while Google Analytics shows 850 for
the same campaign due to different attribution
windows (view-through vs. click-only) and
tracking methods.


• Solution: Designate one platform as
“source of truth”
• Reconcile differences post-campaign
Problem: Competitive activity spike


• Solution: Continue as planned; document
for post-analysis
• Do not add markets or extend test reactively
95%+ 90-94% <90%
<5% 5-10% >10%
<20% 20-30% >30%
<10% 10-20% >20%



## CONDUCT ANALYSIS

DATA PREPARATION

For CRM Data:

After the test period ends, follow the same data
extraction process used for historical data.


(For sample code, see Appendix A, Example 4:
SQL to Python – Extract Raw Transactions.)
For the data extraction implementation, see [extract_raw_transactions.py](./code/extract_raw_transactions.py).

Then apply ZIP-to-DMA mapping.


(For sample code, see Appendix A, Example 5:
Apply ZIP to DMA Mapping and Aggregate.)
For the ZIP-to-DMA mapping implementation, see [zip_to_dma_mapping.py](./code/zip_to_dma_mapping.py).

For Syndicated Data:

Request data pull with these specifications:


• Markets: All 210 US DMAs (or subset used
in test)
• Metrics: [Total sales volume / unit sales /
transactions]
• Time period: [Full date range including pre and
post periods]
• Granularity: Daily (preferred, more statistical
power) or weekly
Allow 5-7 business days after period close for
transaction settlement and data processing, then
freeze the dataset for analysis.


DATA QUALITY CHECKS

If using sales volume (continuous), check
distribution of normalized values.

For the data quality checks implementation, see [data_quality_checks.py](./code/data_quality_checks.py).
For count data, standard t-test typically suffices
unless counts are very low (< 5 per DMA-week), in
which case consider Poisson regression.


(For sample code, see Appendix A, Example 6:
Data Quality Checks.)


PRIMARY ANALYSIS: T-TEST
ON NORMALIZED VALUES

The core analysis follows these steps:

1.
Calculate pre-period baselines for each DMA
2.
Normalize test period sales to account for
DMA heterogeneity
3.
Compare normalized values between
Treatment and Control
4.
Test for statistical significance
(For sample code, see Appendix A, Example 7:
Primary Analysis – t-test on Normalized Values.)


INTERPRETING RESULTS:

The coefficient on assignment Treatment
represents the estimated lift. For example:


Estimate: 0.0342􀀄
Std. Error: 0.0156
t value: 2.19􀀄
p-value: 0.029􀀄
95% CI: [0.0036, 0.0648]􀀄

This indicates a 3.42% lift (p = 0.029), statistically
significant at the 95% confidence level.



OPTIONAL ROBUSTNESS CHECKS

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest basis for causal inference, additional
diagnostic checks can help validate that the estimated treatment effect is not an artifact of pre-existing
differences or instability in the data. These checks are not required in every case but may be useful for
stakeholder reassurance or internal QA in higher-stakes tests.


For sample code, see Appendix A:


•
Example 8 – Difference-in-Differences Cross-Check
•
Example 9 – Leave-One-Out Sensitivity Analysis
•
Example 10 – Pre-Period Balance Check

DESCRIPTION OF CHECKS

1.Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
Compares the change in outcome between Treatment and Control groups from pre- to post-period.
This provides a cross-check that the estimated lift is not merely due to different group trajectories
over time.


2.Pre-Period Balance Check
A simple t-test comparing average pre-treatment outcomes between Treatment and Control groups.
A high p-value (e.g., >0.1) suggests the groups were balanced before treatment, reducing the risk
of confounding.


3.
Leave-One-Out Sensitivity
Runs the treatment effect estimation multiple times, each time excluding one DMA from the
Treatment group. If the estimated lift remains stable across iterations, the result is not overly
influenced by any single region.

## INTERPRET AND ACT

DECISION FRAMEWORK

Based on the results, follow your pre-committed decision rule:


 RESULT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE BUSINESS ACTION
LIFT  TARGET YES
LIFT  TARGET NO
0 < LIFT < TARGET YES
0 < LIFT < TARGET NO
LIFT  0 ANY

COMMON INTERPRETATIONS

“We detected a 3.4% lift (p=0.029)”


• The channel works. Incremental revenue exceeds cost.
• Update MMM coefficients with this experimental prior
• Plan follow-up tests on sub-tactics (creative variants, audiences)
“Lift was 2.1% but not significant (p=0.18)”


• Effect may exist but test was underpowered
• Calculate: Would 2.1% lift be profitable? If yes, consider extending
• Review: Was compliance good? Any unusual events?
“No detectable lift (-0.5%, p=0.72)”


• Channel isn’t moving the needle at current spend levels
• Before cutting: Verify test execution was clean
• Consider: Different creative? Different targeting? Or truly ineffective?
SCALE SPEND PER PLAN
RERUN TEST WITH EXTENDED TIME OR SPEND
OPTIMIZE EFFICIENCY (CREATIVE, TARGETING)
CONSIDER REDUCING/REALLOCATING BUDGET
PAUSE BUDGET AND INVESTIGATE FURTHER


FEEDING BACK TO STRATEGY

UPDATE MARKETING MIX MODELS:

Use the experimental estimate as a Bayesian prior.


(For sample code, see Appendix A, Example 11:
Update Marketing Mix Model with Experimental
Prior)


Plan Next Tests:


Successful experiments often reveal new
questions:


• If social works, which platform drives
most lift?
• Does the effect vary by creative theme?
• Is there a frequency threshold?
Design follow-up experiments using the same
rigorous framework.


CLOSING THE LOOP

Document the full cycle:

1.
Initial Hypothesis: “Social drives 3%+ lift”
2.
Test Result: “Confirmed: 3.4% lift detected”
3.
Business Decision: “Increased budget from
$50MM to $60MM annually”
4.
Actual Outcome: “6 months later: sustained
iROAS of 2.8x on expanded budget”
This creates institutional knowledge and builds
confidence in the experimentation program.

COMMON PITFALLS
AND HOW TO AVOID THEM

DESIGN PHASE PITFALLS

PITFALL: EXCLUDING “IMPORTANT” DMAS

Example:

“Let’s exclude NYC and LA because they’re too big
to risk”


Why it’s wrong:

Scope of sales effect estimate now only applies to
smaller markets


Solution: Include all DMAs; let randomization
handle heterogeneity.


PITFALL: PEEKING AT ASSIGNMENTS

Example:

“Treatment got more large DMAs, let’s re-
randomize”


Why it’s wrong:

Not truly a randomized trail when treatment
groups are cherry-picked8


Solution:
Design test ahead of time with stratification or
re-randomization with pre-specified criteria


PITFALL: VAGUE SUCCESS CRITERIA

Example:

“We’ll see if it works”


Why it’s wrong:

Invites post-hoc rationalization


Solution:

Define specific lift threshold and decision rule
upfront


EXECUTION PHASE PITFALLS

PITFALL: MID-FLIGHT ASSIGNMENT
CHANGES

Example:

“Dallas is underdelivering, let’s swap it to Control”


Why it’s wrong:

Destroys randomization and causal inference


Solution:
Fix delivery issues with bid/budget changes only


PITFALL: CREATIVE VARIATIONS BY REGION

Example:

“Let’s test the new creative in Treatment DMAs”


Why it’s wrong:

Confounds media effect with creative effect


Solution:

Keep all non-media variables constant; Conduct
creative testing or versioning as a separate

experiment

PITFALL: REACTING TO EARLY RESULTS

Example:

“Week 2 looks great, let’s double spending”


Why it’s wrong:

Early results are noisy; changes compromise test


Solution:

Stick to the plan; save learnings for next test


8Optional stopping and the false discoveryrate” (Hussey, 2018)

ANALYSIS PHASE PITFALLS

PITFALL: CHERRY-PICKING METRICS

Example:

“Revenue was flat but look at this segment!”


Why it’s wrong:

Multiple testing without pre-specified design intent


Solution:

Pre-specify primary KPI; treat others as
exploratory


PITFALL: IGNORING FAILED RANDOMIZATION

Example:

“Treatment had 20% higher pre-period sales but
that’s OK”


Why it’s wrong:

Imbalance can masquerade as treatment effect


Solution:

Use normalized metrics or covariate adjustment


PITFALL: OVER-INTERPRETING
MARGINAL RESULTS

Example:

“p=0.048, so it definitely works!”


Why it’s wrong:

Threshold thinking ignores uncertainty


Solution:

Focus on confidence intervals and practical
significance

## CONCLUSION

A well-designed geographic randomized controlled trial provides the gold standard
for measuring advertising incrementality. By following this playbook, you can transform

your organization’s approach to marketing measurement and unlock significant

competitive advantages.

BUILDING A CULTURE OF
EXPERIMENTATION

The framework presented here – built on
hundreds of real-world experiments – provides
more than just a methodology. It represents a
fundamental shift in how organizations should
approach marketing ROI. While competitors
continue relying on correlation-based attribution
models and quasi-experimental methods that
systematically overstate digital performance,
companies that embrace geographic
experimentation gain a decisive edge. In markets
where share is zero-sum and growth comes
at competitors’ expense, understanding what
truly drives incremental sales becomes your
secret weapon, demonstrably changing perception
of marketing from a cost center
into a growth accelerator.


WHILE COMPETITORS CONTINUE
RELYING ON CORRELATION-BASED
ATTRIBUTION MODELS AND
QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
THAT SYSTEMATICALLY OVERSTATE
DIGITAL PERFORMANCE,
COMPANIES THAT EMBRACE
GEOGRAPHIC EXPERIMENTATION
GAIN A DECISIVE EDGE.

STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION
FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT

Start your experimentation journey with your
largest spend categories, where even modest
improvements in efficiency drive material business
impact. A 5% improvement in a $100M channel
delivers far more value than a 50% improvement
in a $1M channel. But don’t stop there –
systematically work through your entire marketing
mix:


1.
Channel Validation: Test all major
channels to establish true incremental
contribution
2.
Risk Mitigation: Never cut substantial
spending without rigorous testing. Channels
that appear ineffective in attribution models
or with matched-market testing may be
driving significant incremental sales
3.
Opportunity Discovery: Investigate
underinvested channels like audio, outdoor,
and linear TV where attention may be high
and CPMs low, potentially offering better
returns than oversaturated digital channels
4.
Tactical Optimization: After channel-
level validation, test media partners, creative
variants, audience segments, and messaging
strategies
5.
Continuous Calibration: Track whether
mix changes deliver expected sales impact

FROM INSIGHTS TO INTELLIGENCE

As your organization builds a repository of experimental results – tens, then hundreds, eventually
thousands of tests – you develop the industry’s clearest picture of what drives incremental sales.

THIS EXPERIMENTAL BENCHMARK BECOMES YOUR COMPETITIVE MOAT. MAKE BOLD
MOVES BACKED BY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE WHILE COMPETITORS HESITATE.
Enabling:

• Predictive Modeling: Build AI models grounded in causal evidence rather than correlations
(see “Predictive Incrementality by Experimentation”9
for advanced applications)
• Strategic Confidence: Make bold moves backed by experimental evidence while competitors hesitate
• Compound Learning: Each experiment builds on previous insights, accelerating your pace of discovery
THE PATH FORWARD

Geographic RCTs offer simplicity in design but
profound impact in results. By randomly assigning
regions, delivering media, and measuring
outcomes, you cut through the noise of modern
marketing analytics. The careful attention to
design details, statistical power, operational
excellence, and analytical rigor pays dividends in
decision quality.


This whitepaper demonstrates that while running
experiments requires rigor and attention to detail,
it’s not as complicated or expensive as many
marketers fear. This isn’t rocket science,
it’s marketing science.

The real cost isn’t in the resources required
or the temporary sales suspension in control
markets. The real cost is making million-dollar
media decisions based on flawed measurement
while billions in revenue opportunity hang in the
balance.


Every day spent optimizing against inaccurate
signals is a day your competitors might be using
better evidence to steal your customers.


That said, executing geographic experiments
well requires expertise, infrastructure, and
sustained commitment. Not every organization
needs to build this capability in-house.


your partner, bringing battle-tested
methodology and platform capabilities to
make geographic experimentation painless
and optimal for your business.

Remember: every failed experiment that
prevents wasted spend is as valuable as a
successful test that identifies a winning strategy.
In the words often attributed to Thomas Edison,
“”I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways
that won’t work.“


Start today. Pick your largest channel. Design
a test. Let real science, not assumptions or
statistical mysticism, guide your next million-
dollar decision. Soon, you’ll be in the company
of leading marketing experimentation experts
like Netflix, Uber, Airbnb and other market
leaders and wonder how you ever made decisions
without this level of evidence.
